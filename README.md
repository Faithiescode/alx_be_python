INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON QUESTIONS

TASK ZERO
Create a file named basic_operations.py.
In this file, you will define two variables: number1 and number2, with the values 10 and 5, respectively.
You do not need to write any functions or import any modules.
Calculate the sum, difference (by subtracting number2 from number1), and product of number1 and number2.
Print the results of each operation in the format: [operation] of [number1] and [number2] is [result].# alx_be_python


TASK ONE
Create a file named simple_interest.py.
Define three variables in this file:
principal with a value of 1000 (representing $1000),
rate with a value of 0.05 (representing 5% annual interest rate),
time with a value of 3 (representing 3 years).
Calculate the simple interest using the formula provided and store the result in a variable named interest.
Print the calculated interest in a format: The simple interest is: [interest].

TASK TWO 
Create a file named rectangle_area.py.
Define two variables in this file:
length with a value representing the length of the rectangle.
width with a value representing the width of the rectangle.
For simplicity, let’s use length = 10 and width = 5.
Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula (Area = length × width) and store the result in a variable named area.
Print the calculated area in a format: The area of the rectangle is: [area].

TASK THREE
Create a file named hours_to_seconds.py.
Define a variable named hours and assign it a value representing the number of hours you want to convert to seconds. Use hours = 2.
Calculate the number of seconds in the given hours. Remember, there are 3600 seconds in an hour (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 60 seconds in a minute, thus 60 x 60 = 3600).
Store the result of the conversion in a variable named seconds.
Print the result in the format: [hours] hour(s) is [seconds] seconds.

TASK FOUR
Create a file named future_age_calculator.py.
Prompt the user to input their current age with the question: “How old are you? ”.
Assume the user will input a valid integer value.
Calculate how old the user will be in the year 2050. To keep calculations simple, assume the current year is 2023. Therefore, you need to add 27 years to the user’s current age.
Print the user’s age in 2050 in the format: In 2050, you will be [age] years old.


TASK FIVE 
User Input for Financial Details:

Prompt the user for their monthly income: “Enter your monthly income: ”.
Ask for their total monthly expenses: “Enter your total monthly expenses: ”.
Calculate Monthly Savings:

Calculate the monthly savings by subtracting monthly expenses from the monthly income.
Project Annual Savings:

Assume a simple annual interest rate of 5%.
Calculate the projected savings after one year, incorporating the interest. Use the simplified formula for annual savings projection: (Projected Savings = Monthly Savings * 12 + (Monthly Savings * 12 * 0.05)).
Output Results:

Display the user’s monthly savings.
Display the projected annual savings after including interest.
